This is a Cosmos App project bootstrapped with [`create-cosmos-app`](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/create-cosmos-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the packages and run the development server:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## How to connect to Spawn chains

2. Make sure the Spawn generated chain is up and running
3. Go to `./config/spawn.ts` to edit the default Spawn chain config if needed
4. Run `yarn dev` and open http://localhost:3000, select "Rollchain" (or other custom chain names) from the chain dropdown in the top right corner, then click "Connect Wallet" in the left sidebar to connect to the chain
5. Go to "Faucet" to get some test tokens and enjoy!
