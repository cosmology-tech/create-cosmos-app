## Introduction

This example demonstrates the usage of React hooks provided by [injective-react](https://github.com/hyperweb-io/interchainjs/tree/main/libs/injective-react) and how to interact with the Injective blockchain on the frontend.

## Getting Started

First, install the packages and run the development server:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to build a React application that interacts with the Injective blockchain. By following this guide, you will learn how to set up a development environment, use React hooks, and integrate various Cosmos ecosystem tools to enhance your application.

## Query and Tx Hooks

This example uses the query hooks(e.g. useGetBalance) and tx hooks(e.g. useSend) from the `injective-react` package to interact with the Injective blockchain. These hooks allow you to query data from the blockchain and send transactions to the blockchain.

```js
import { useDelegate } from "injective-react/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/tx.rpc.func";
import { useGetValidators } from "injective-react/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/query.rpc.func";

const {
  data,
  isSuccess: isGetValidatorsDone,
  isLoading: isGetValidatorsLoading,
} = useGetValidators({
  request: {
    status: "BOND_STATUS_BONDED",
  },
  options: {
    context: defaultContext,
    enabled: !validatorAddress,
  },
  rpcClient,
});

const { mutate: delegate, isSuccess: isDelegateSuccess } = useDelegate({
  clientResolver: signingClient,
  options: {
    context: defaultContext,
    onSuccess: (data: any) => {
      console.log("onSuccess", data);
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      console.log("onError", error);
    },
  },
});
```
